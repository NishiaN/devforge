DevForge v9.0 — 39-module web app.
Build: `node build.js` → devforge-v9.html (~484KB)
Test: `npm test` → 127 tests + 248 assertions
Edit files in src/, never the output. Vanilla JS only.
Key rules: define `const G=S.genLang==='ja'` in gen functions, never ${} in single quotes.
getEntityColumns always needs 3rd arg knownEntities.
After edits: `npm test && node build.js`
